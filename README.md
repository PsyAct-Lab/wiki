Welcome to the lab's new wiki page! We hope it will be pleasant to work with this wiki.

# Getting Started

This wiki is based on Markdown, a language for formatting text (similar to latex). Markdown is a powerful little tool to write, and we recommend that you read up a bit on it.

To add pages, simply add new files to the github repository using the button on the front page. Then you can edit that file in your browser.
For better control, it is recommended to make a new branch and create pull requests (GUIDE TO BE ADDED).
